# electron-shadcn-typescript

An Electron desktop app boilerplate with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui — all 47 shadcn components already installed, so you can start building the actual app.

## Features

- **All 47 shadcn/ui components pre-installed** — accordion to tooltip, already wired to Tailwind and Radix. No `shadcn-ui add` runs needed.
- **Dark / light theme** out of the box via `next-themes` and a ready `ThemeProvider`.
- **electron-vite** for fast dev with HMR in the renderer.
- **electron-builder** configured for Windows, macOS and Linux, with app icons in `build/`.
- **Auto-updates** ready — `electron-updater` is already a dependency and `dev-app-update.yml` is in place.
- **TypeScript everywhere** — separate `tsconfig` for main, preload and renderer, plus ESLint and Prettier.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) + [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
